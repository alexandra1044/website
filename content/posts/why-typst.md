# What?
Typst is designed as a competitor in the typesetting space to LaTeX, albeit designed to be a lot easier to use.

# Why?
Typst is designed to be as user-friendly as possible whilst still being able to generate beautiful documents. You can make a document identical to how you would in LaTeX in a shorter space of time. Typst also has much more comprehensible error messages for debugging your own code without resorting to StackOverflow.

If you're still hanging on to Microsoft Word because LaTeX seems too complicated, Typst is for you!

# Where?
Go to https://typst.app/ to make a free account. 

# Resources
There are a selection of great materials to make using Typst easy. Below are the ones I use:
1. Easy beginner's tutorial - https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/
2. Great book of examples - https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book/about.html
